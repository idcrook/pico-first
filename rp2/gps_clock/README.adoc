= Work In Progress: Clock on Pico using GPS Receiver
:xrefstyle: short

Uses 5V and 3.3V I2C devices connected to Raspberry Pi Pico to implement a clock with time backed by GPS module.

== List of Files

A list of files with descriptions of their function

lcd/:: Wrapper code for I2C LCD Character display.

test_lcd.py:: Example code for using LCD Character display.

digits/:: **TBD**: Wrapper code for I2C 7-segment LED display for displaying current time

gps/:: **TBD**: Wrapper code for serial interface GPS module that has a PPS output


== Wiring information

See <<gps_clock-wiring-diagram>> **TBD** for wiring instructions.

| *Item*                    | *5V Safe*? | *3V3 Support*? | *Details*
| Raspberry Pi Pico         | *NO*  | Yes   | Not 5V safe; SMPS outputs 3V3
| 4-channel Level Converter | Yes   | Yes   | Allows SDA/SCL crossing
| GPS Module                | Yes   | Yes   | 3V3 VCC in Datasheet
| 1.2" 7-Segment LED Display| Yes   | Yes   | VCCIO input allows SDA/SCL @3V3
| i2c LCD backpack          | Yes   | *NO*  | Requires 5V for operation
|===

- * _1.2 inch 4-Digit 7-Segment LED_: Supports optional "VCCIO", which should allow direct 3V3 safe I2C; LED supply VCC must be 5V
- _GPS Module_: Datasheet says operational with 3V3 VCC and IO, with typical operation 5V VCC
- _Standard LCD 16x2_: Display and backlight require 5V; connect through logic-level converter
