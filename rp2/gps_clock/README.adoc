=== Voltage Notes

- _1.2 inch 4-Digit 7-Segment LED_: Supports optional "VCCIO", which should allow direct 3V3 safe I2C; LED supply VCC must be 5V
- _GPS Module_: Datasheet says operational with 3V3 VCC and IO, with typical operation 5V VCC
- _Standard LCD 16x2_: Display and backlight require 5V; connect through logic-level converter
